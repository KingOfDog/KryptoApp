# KryptoApp
KryptoApp is a small JavaScript /w Electron application which provides the user a variety of less comlex encryption algorithms. There is a list of all implemented encryptions down below.

It was originaly only intended for a school project, meanwhile, I added more features etc. and now published it here on GitHub. There is no reason I could come up with why KryptoApp could be useful to have downloaded, as it has no practical use case. However, you can use it either in your browser or download the release version created with the Electron framework.

I'm not planning to expand this app in the future, but as always there is the possibility that I change my mind.

If you have any ideas for KryptoApp, feal free to create an issue with your proposal, so I'll might implement it, or to fork this repository and add it yourself.
